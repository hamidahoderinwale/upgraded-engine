        The Learnathon is a chance to finally dive deep into a topic that piqued
        your curiosity, but you never pursued; a problem you’re itching to
        solve; or an issue you’re trying to make sense of. It’s a space to
        spend a few concerted hours exploring a new topic, subject, or idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        Running Learnathons are really easy. If you do run one, I think it's
        important to set the scene for what to do. An email was sent out about
        a week in advance, so people could think about what they might do,
        collect resources, etc.

        Learning is ominous. Deliverables are great! A blog post, a
        written-out-proof, some slightly less buggy code.

        Whatever it is, learning by doing is supreme. But, it's also reasonable
        and encouraged to just try and understand whatever it is you want to
        wrap your mind around (that's what I did!). A slightly-complex research
        paper is a great start, especially if it's related to other work you're
        trying to accomplish.

          graciously supported the event. The initial inspiration for running
          this was a{" "}

            friend club</a> at his school.

      <p>Here's the structure we followed:</p>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>15 minute pre-amble</li>
          <li>1 hour work time</li>
          <li>15 minute breaktime</li>
          <li>1 hour work time</li>
          <li>15+ minute debrief</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    
      <p>In total it was 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        Note that the time frame is super short! It was nice. You build enough
        momentum that you can continue if you'd like. If not, it's a nice boost
        of motivation to do something else. But, at least you did something!
        This is probably the most valuable takeaway. Just do something.

        around with code; caught up on reading; researched thyroid imbalances,{" "}

        Overall, it was really great to run (albeit I didn't have to actually
        do that much). People are usually excited to talk about things that
        excite them. This is a fun catalyst for great conversations too.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most notable thing was just how the mood changed. Co-working
        sessions are great, but I think there's this pressure to have something
        to talk about by the end, so you just end up actually trying. There's
        nothing concrete to display, so you just get guided ramblings (which is
        really dope).
      </p>

      <p>In short, run one!</p>
